# MegaBot
StarCraft bot designed to test strategy selection. For MegaBot, strategy is the incorporation of another bot's behavior. Currently it incorporates Skynet, Xelnaga and NUSBot.

## Competitions
### CIG 2016
This is MegaBot's debut in StarCraft AI Tournaments hosted in AI conferences. 

On the first stage, MegaBot placed 5th among 16 competitors. On the second stage, composed of first stage's top-8 competitors, MegaBot placed 7th. Detailed results at: https://sites.google.com/site/starcraftaic/result. We are in the [highlights video](https://www.facebook.com/cjdahrl/videos/1155031857896481/)! :) 

Performance dropped on the second stages due to many crashes... the integration of 3 bots' codes is not perfect.

### SSCAIT
